This blog is like an attic where I put stuff that doesn't fit in any of those categories. Up to January 2024 there was quite a lot of old stuff here which I have now removed. Contact me if you are looking for something ancient and can't find it.

## Bio

I was based in Sarajevo 1997-2017, where I did a lot of research in B&H and the Balkans. 

In Sarajevo I cofounded [proMENTE social research](http://proMENTE.org), where I also worked. Prior to proMENTE, I worked as Programme Manager of a series of academic and training projects for students and psychosocial professionals in South-East Europe for the University of Munich with [Prof. Willi Butollo](http://butollo.de).

Now I have moved with my family to Clevedon, near Bristol in the UK, where I am working with [Causal Map Ltd](http:/causalmap.app) to build the first (we think) app for causal QDA. This is a really exciting voyage of discovery.

As you might be able to guess from the above, I have studied philosophy, maths and psychology.


## Work

### Web apps

- [Causal Map](https://app.causalmap.app) - for constructing causal maps from text.
- [Qualia](https://manage.QualiaInterviews.com) - an AI interviewer for evaluation and social research.
- [Theorymaker](https://theorymaker.netlify.app) - for constructing Theories of Change.


### Evaluation

I have been lucky enough to work in about 30 different countries (mainly SE Europe, S & SE Asia / Pacific, Sub-Saharan Africa) on a wide variety of topics from disaster response in Haiti and psychosocial programming after the 2004 tsunami to social capital in the former Soviet Union and counting stray dogs in Sarajevo. 

### Everyone Counts

As a freelancer, I often work for international development and disaster recovery programmes. This has meant working with some great people, especially at the [IFRC](http://ifrc.org). I was honoured to be Lead Researcher and Statistican for several global ["Everyone counts"](https://data.ifrc.org/everyone-counts-report-and-analysis) reports based on the FDRS.

## Theories of Change in evaluation

My special interest is causal mapping and theories of change in evaluation.

A while ago I wrote a set of <a href="/static/slides.html" data-router-ignore>slides</a> on Theories of Change.

I also provide a free web app for constructing graphical Theories of Change called [Theorymaker](https://theorymaker.netlify.app). There have been many versions, [here](https://theorymaker.netlify.app) is the latest one.

## Publications

### Causal mapping

Our [Garden](https://garden.causalmap.app) of causal mapping ideas.

See the [bilbiography](https://garden.causalmap.app/bibliography).

### Psychology

My academic research has been mainly in the field of clinical psychology especially after war, covering Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and [post-traumatic growth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=RVSHfkAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=RVSHfkAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C).

This work was mostly together with colleagues from Sarajevo and the University of Munich, especially [Maria Hagl](http://lmu-munich.academia.edu/MariaHagl). My [PhD](https://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/8402/1/StephenPowellPhD.pdf) sums it up.
