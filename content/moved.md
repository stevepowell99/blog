title: Moved to Clevedon, UK!

This is just to say that I've moved with my family to Clevedon, UK - leaving Sarajevo after very nearly 20 years, ... leaving a whole heap of dear friends and family behind, but meeting up with new and old friends and family over here in rainy Blighty. I'm still involved with [proMENTE](http://proMENTE.org) but obviously in a more remote capacity. I'm only using my personal email address steve AT pogol.net from now on. 

I'm looking to meet up and network with people from the evaluation and social research worlds in South-West England, so do get in touch if you are interested.

I'm still [blogging](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevepowell99/detail/recent-activity/posts/) sporadically at LinkedIn - you'll find more [over there](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevepowell99/detail/recent-activity/posts/) than here at this blog, which I mainly use for odds and ends.
