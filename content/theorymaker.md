Since about 2012 (I think) I've been providing an app called Theorymaker as a simple text-based way to construct theories of change for evaluators. It's always been free. It was used by hundreds of people over the years. Unfortunately a few days ago the app ceased to function for a reason I don't understand. Probably Amazon AWS (where it is hosted) have changed something I'm not aware of. I'm so busy at the moment with [Causal Map](https://causalmap.app) that sadly I don't have time to work out what's happened and fix it.

You can still reach it at http://ec2-52-36-229-220.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/: you might get a security warning but you can ignore that.

I made an AI version here: https://causalmap.shinyapps.io/theorymaker3/. 

If you have a ChatGPT Plus there is an [amazing app which does all of this and more](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-5QhhdsfDj-diagrams-show-me).

I'm very sorry that the original app is no longer available and for any inconvenience this might have caused. When I get a bit more spare time I'll see if I can find out what happened. [Get in touch](mailto:steve@pogol.net) if you need anything.
