A billionaire left 10 million EUR in his will to establish a trust, with instructions that it should be used to "just do good". 

During the ten years since then, support for same-sex marriage has shifted from 10% to 80% public approval, and almost all liberals are now in favour.

In the ninth year, the trust gives 1 million to a campaign for a law on marriage equality, which substantially contributes to the passing of a law in the tenth year.

We don't know for sure, but most likely the billionaire, like most of his peers and friends, did not support marriage equality when he was alive. But most of his peers and friends now support it.

Now, in the 11th year, you are asked to evaluate whether the trust was run according to the wishes of the billionaire.
