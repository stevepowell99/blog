In its report, CARE say they saved the villagers from being swept away in the flood. 

A critic argues, even if CARE hadn't intervened (counterfactual), the villagers wouldn't have been swept away, because there was a surplus of aid agencies around with suitable boats, and most of them in fact had nothing to do. Ergo, CARE's contribution didn't make any difference.
