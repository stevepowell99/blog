# Beaufort and Rubrics

A quick post about the Beaufort scale for wind speed, see below, as paradigm of a rubric. 

[Rubrics](http://betterevaluation.org/en/evaluation-options/rubrics) are really important in evaluation. 

The Beaufort Scale is just a beautiful example of clearly defined, easily observable criteria. I love the way different features like smoke (lower wind speeds) become important at different wind speeds. At force 6, umbrella use becomes difficult - umbrellas are not mentioned elsewhere but it gives you a great idea of what force 6 feels like and so helps to anchor the scale. 

In particular, I love the way the individual statements are mostly relatively objective, or rather, inter-subjective, i.e. they are likely to be understood by different people from different backgrounds in a similar way. In the social realm it is often hard to be so objective and so rubrics in project evaluation often include formulations like "effective", "reasonably good overall" or "just about adequate" which are again not inter-subjective and so in a way beg the question. 


This must have been a big improvement for the Navy before the advent of mechanical windspeed measurement.

Another fascinating thing is that it manages to break a quantity like wind speed into no less than 12 different levels. In evaluation, we mostly see rubrics limited to 4-7 levels. 

Wikipedia says the Beaufort scale was extended in 1946, when forces 13 to 17 were added, but they are only used in typhoon countries.

I always thought it would be hard to really distinguish 10, 11 and 12 though. And on the other hand, numbers are still needed beyond 12 especially in the tropics.

I wonder if that is because  the scale is linearly anchored to windspeed. I would have thought that perception of windspeed, like most other things like light and sound, would be logarithmic so that there should be more frequent divisions at the lower ends and bigger jumps at the higher extremes. If the number/windspeed ratio was logarithmic, 10 11 and 12 would cover ever increasing spreads of windspeed and would neatly extend to cover just about any hurricane. 

An example of where assuming a linear relationship with a physical quantity has unfortunate consequences. The developers of the scale would probably have been better advised to ignore the physical windspeed and concentrate on what can be inter-subjectively distinguished. It is not even obvious that the span of each rubric in terms of physical windspeed, or its logarithm, or indeed in terms of anything else, need to be equal at all - even subjectively. That all depends on what the rubric-based rating is going to be used for.
