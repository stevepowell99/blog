Since about 2012 (I think) I've been providing an app called Theorymaker as a simple text-based way to construct theories of change for evaluators. It's always been free. It was used by hundreds of people over the years. Unfortunately about a year ago I decided I didn't have time to maintain it and shut it down. However, now with genAI-supported coding there is really no excuse, so Theorymaker lives again at theorymaker.netlify.app. 

- Theorymaker is good at laying out even complicated diagrams easily, finding good positions for nodes and links.

- There's an AI which knows some things about theories of change so it can create a whole diagram for you and/or you can chat to improve an existing one.
- Apart from the AI chat, you can use it completely offline. 
- Your diagram is still defined by text and there's still a text editor, so you can quickly tweak your diagrams like that if you want.
- Now the diagram is interactive: you can really quickly add styles and add nodes and grouping boxes
- You can save and share your diagrams with a URL, and/or copy an image to clipboard.
- You can create arrows between grouping boxes as well as between nodes
- To an extent, you can specify the order of your nodes and boxes



💥⛔**Use another tool** if:

- If you want a different kind of diagram, which does not simply involve multiple nodes, links and grouping boxes
- If you want custom positions for your diagram components. Theorymaker is opinionated about positioning (auto layout). It is not freeform drag-and-drop positioning.
- If you want fully-featured ToC software with indicators, monitoring, etc.
