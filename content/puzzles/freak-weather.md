Two NGOs prepare ships to help people stranded after a tsunami on a remote island.

NGO A is well-prepared and sets sail in time.

NGO B has barely enough equipment and leaves too late to do any good.

A freak hurricane sends ship A back to base but slings ship B miles ahead.

Ship B reaches the island and just manages to save many lives.

Ship A still manages to arrive on time but its help is no longer needed.

Which NGO was most effective? Which had the most impact? Which should be praised the most? Did NGO A fail?
