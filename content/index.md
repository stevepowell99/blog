This blog is like an attic where I put stuff that doesn't fit in any of those categories. Up to January 2024 there was quite a lot of old stuff here which I have now removed. Contact me if you are looking for something ancient and can't find it.

## Bio

I was based in Sarajevo 1997-2017, where I did a lot of research in B&H and the Balkans. 

In Sarajevo I cofounded [proMENTE social research](http://proMENTE.org), where I also worked. Prior to proMENTE, I worked as Programme Manager of a series of academic and training projects for students and psychosocial professionals in South-East Europe for the University of Munich with [Prof. Willi Butollo](http://butollo.de).

Now I have moved with my family to Clevedon, near Bristol in the UK, where I am working with [Causal Map Ltd](http:/causalmap.app) to build the first (we think) app for causal QDA. This is a really exciting voyage of discovery.

As you might be able to guess from the above, I have studied philosophy, maths and psychology.


## Work

### Projects

I have over 25 years' experience in research, monitoring and evaluation, as well as communicating the results, in about 30 different countries (mainly SE Europe, S & SE Asia / Pacific, Sub-Saharan Africa) on a wide variety of topics from disaster response in Haiti and psychosocial programming after the 2004 tsunami to social capital in the former Soviet Union, biodiversity in W Africa, community resilience in East Africa and counting stray dogs in Sarajevo. 

I am strong in both quantitative (GIS, “big data”, online & mobile, SPSS; R) and qualitative (Outcome Mapping, text analysis) research and evaluation approaches. I try to make my evidence-gathering transparent and am convinced of the importance of reproducible research.

As a freelancer, I mostly deal with monitoring, evaluation and research for international development and disaster recovery programmes. This has meant working with some great people, especially at the [IFRC](http://ifrc.org). So I set up M&E systems and also conduct evaluations and carry out research. Subject-wise I try to remain a generalist, because I love dipping into different themes as necessary, from environmental protection and beneficiary communication to volunteerism and PTSD.


## Theories of Change in evaluation

My special interest is causal mapping and theories of change in evaluation.

A while ago I wrote a set of [slides](static/slides.html) on Theories of Change.

I also provide a free web app for constructing graphical Theories of Change called [Theorymaker](https://theorymaker.netlify.app). There have been many versions, [here](https://theorymaker.netlify.app) is the latest one.

## Publications

My academic research has been mainly in the field of clinical psychology especially after war, covering Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and [post-traumatic growth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=RVSHfkAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=RVSHfkAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C).

This work was mostly together with colleagues from Sarajevo and the University of Munich, especially [Maria Hagl](http://lmu-munich.academia.edu/MariaHagl). My [PhD](https://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/8402/1/StephenPowellPhD.pdf) sums it up.
