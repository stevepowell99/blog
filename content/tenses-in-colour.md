Decades ago I spent a lot of time working on how to present the
English tenses to my language students. I came up with a set of
colour-coded charts which were pretty popular with my students. Since them they have
been languishing.  
So now I have published them here as an open source project.  
This is one of the charts:

The charts themselves are available as a [powerpoint
file](/static/tenses/tensesCharts.ppt) for downloading (in this
version you can switch the explanations on and off).

There is also a corresponding list of tenses available as a
[pdf](/static/tenses/tensesList.pdf) or
[word](/static/tenses/tensesList.doc) file.
